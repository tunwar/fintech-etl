A project to better visualise personal spending habits across accounts with `challenger banks` such as Monzo and Revolut.

## Plan
- Initial exploration of Monzo API's - 
  - Create map of transactions with OSM - :heavy_check_mark:
  - Create graphs using transaction data - :x:
    - Research different libraries to help with this - :x:
